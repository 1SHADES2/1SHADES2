- 👋 Hi, I’m @1SHADES2 a person of many talents in varietys industries, but I take pride in being a parent...dad for my kids.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... just being with my kids most of the day. Having fun, doing whatever puts a smile on their face. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... a couple or few new trades because I can't seem to find something that interest me, except for another one way to get ahead in life but most of all, feeling wanted and needed because I enjoy helping others as well as get offered a lending hand.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... rebuilding a new foundation in my chaotic lifestyle that is supported by the best I.team-hub that is overseen by the higher power God.!!!////////////$$$$$$\\\\\\\\\\\\!!! I'm looking willing to listen to other words of wisdom through their experiences and gain knowledge that can help me help anyone. 🙏 
- 📫 How to reach me ... well you have to walk around and find out because I seem to be everywhere mentally or physically or maybe in my world. If you happen to be walking with the sun shining on you next to a group of kis than you are close because the sun is still shining on us given hope with its ray of light. Than again, you might have just missed me striking forward to another hustle never looking backwith a positive mindset.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... some1, K.No.1...Im.1.We.R.1.Team
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I love to cook, but most of all, I love holding a womans hand walking off into the sunset after a productive day which I miss. One will come when a special woman will hold my hand and I will cherish not only her but the day that it comes.("_,")
