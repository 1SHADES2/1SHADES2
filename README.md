- 👋 Hi, I’m @1SHADES2 a person of many talents in varietys industries, but I take pride in being a parent...dad for my kids.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... just being with my kids all day having fun doing whatever puts a smile on their face. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... a couple or few new trades because I can't seem to find something that interest me except for another one.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... rebuilding a new foundation that is supposed by the best I.team-hub that is overseen by the higher power God.!!!////////////$$$$$$\\\\\\\\\\\\!!!
- 📫 How to reach me ... well you have to walk around and when you see a bunch of kids in a certain sunny spot you might have found me or not, might be in class learning.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... some1, K.No.1...Im.1.We.R.1.Team
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I love to cook but most of all I love holding a real womans hand which I miss and cant wait for the day to come where 1 can hold mine.("_,")
